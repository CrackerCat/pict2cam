# Pict2Cam
Pict2Cam is an Android fake camera application used to feed camera intents with files in your device's storage.
This means that you can provide any image in your device to apps that require you to take photos from a camera app.

The app also comes bundled with an image resizer so you can process the image before passing it to the
original app that requested the camera image.
